a cpu is the backbone of a computer, without it the computer will not function.

cpu's speed is measured in a term called clock speed this is referred to in gigahertz (GHZ) 1 gigahert is equal to 1 billion instructions carried out by the cpu so if you have a single core 4 gigahert cpu it will process 4 billion instructions, now if you have a 2 core 2 gigahert cpu it will equal the same ammount of instructions processed but it will do it faster
